# UseAudio-ASX-Plugiator
UseAudio ASX / Plugiator (and also iCON X-Synth...) module analysis and tools

I own a UseAudio ASX module and two iCON X-Synth modules (which are exactly the same electronic board) and when UseAudio ceased activity, I wanted to be able to maintain them. This repository contains the work I have done to understand how the boards were working, as my ASX stopped working one day and I wanted to save it.
Note that the schematics are not the original one, this is a work I did manually by checking one copper track at a time (as I am a SHARC DSP developper, I did not start from a white sheet of paper...). I can not guarantee that the schematics is exact, and in all cases, it is not complete (I have not investigated the DAI section of the DSP, which feeds the codec)

**All design rights for the ASX / Plugiator / X-Synth modules are inDSP property!**

I share this work for information only and help other users to save/maintain their modules, as UseAudio does not exist anymore and can not provide any support

I was using Proteus CAD when I draw the first version of the schematics, I have switched to Kicad meanwhile, but I have not yet ported the schematics to Kicad
